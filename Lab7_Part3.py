INSTRUCTIONS:
Write a Python script in a file named Lab7_Part3.py.
Start with a 3x3 array via assignment.
Print out this array, and also find and print out the transpose of this array.
A 3x3 array is considered a matrix. The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix obtained by swapping the
columns and rows of the original matrix.
For example:
The original array
[[1 2 3
[4 5 6]
[7 8 9]]
The transposed array:
[[1 4 7
[2 5 8]
[3 6 9]]
